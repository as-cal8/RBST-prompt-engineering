# zero shot learning

# few shot learning
## Chain of thought (CoT) prompting
## add " do it Step-by-step" often better output
## "take a deep breath" - more detailed step by step
### invoking specialized training material

# personas

# providing context
# experiment with multimodality - combine image, file, text input


# split up complex tasks in simple ones

# generated knowledge prompting 
## first ask it to generate some facts about the questions to come


# tree of thought - complex tasks tell it multi experts conversation
## therefore the system runs it multiple times and compares results


# directional stimulus prompting
## in the prompt include directions by hints or keywords


# chain of density (CoD) 
## combining above approaches for large summarizations
