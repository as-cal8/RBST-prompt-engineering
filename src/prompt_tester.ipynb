This includes centralized collision avoidance, fleet management, internal simulator, and management of vehicle status.  Click here to learn more about key components in the Dronology core.

Vaadin is an open-source web framework that supports development of rich user interfaces.  It has a server-side architecture, which allows most of the logic to run on the server, while Ajax technology on the client side ensures a rich and highly interactive UI.
